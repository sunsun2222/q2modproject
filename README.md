# card attorney {WIP}
To install the mod, create a new folder called "card attorney" in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2
place the files in this repo in there, and make a shortcut of the quake 2 exe with the file path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2\quake2.exe" +set game "card attorney"
if that launches the rerelease, just set steam to always launch quake 2 original, and place that file path in the advanced settings
