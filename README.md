# card attorney {WIP}
To install the mod, create a new folder called "card attorney" in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2
place the files in this repo in there, and make a shortcut of the quake 2 exe with the file path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2\quake2.exe" +set game "card attorney"
if that launches the rerelease, just set steam to always launch quake 2 original, and place that file path in the advanced settings

# How to play
Murder Investigation Round
2-6 players preferably, the investigation round starts when one player is assigned to be the murderer. They have 1:30 to find a victim to kill (a neutral npc or monster), when they kill someone their murder weapon will be dropped as an evidence card, which can be obtained by any player if they find the body during the round. The round ends if either the body is found, or time runs out. If no one is killed by the end of the round, then a random player will die from “poison”, once the round ends, the court round can begin

Court Round
Once the round starts, players will get sorted into either defense or prosecution, and a best of 3 last one standing match will start. Whoever picked up the murder weapon card will have it added to their deck at the beginning. On each team, there is a lead attorney who will get 1 special card. Each regular player starts with 5 cards, which are randomly chosen. Playing a card will either buff the player, debuff the enemy, or change your weapon. Best of 3 between the two teams until one wins.

Win Conditions
Whoever wins the best of three gets the desired verdict; the winners are innocent, the losers are guilty.
If the murderer is guilty and is not on the prosecution, the prosecution gets an extra point
If the murderer is guilty and is on the prosecution, the entire defense gets 2 points
If both teams tie on the third round, both sides are guilty, no points
If the defense uses an accuse card and wins, they get an extra point.
If a team wins 3-0, they are really innocent, and get double points, if the murderer is on this team, they get triple points.
Individual points carry over into the next set of rounds, starting at the investigation round again.
